•	Because programming is Fun!
•	Because I love money and there are like a bazillion jobs for developers!
•	Because I have a million and one ideas, leading in different directions, and the only possible skill I believe that ties them all together is programming.
•	Because my favorite outfit are my pajamas, and I really want the option to work at home one day

  The truth is that there are too many reasons to count, but if I had to pick one reason I would say, “Because in today’s environment, one can’t afford not to know how to code”. Elements of Software development/programming/coding have become paramount in everyday life. Most forms of communication, transportation, entertainment, etc. have all become dependent upon it, and the need for it grows everyday.
  
  Growing up, I remember everyone asking me, who I wanted to be in my life, and what I wanted to accomplish, expecting nothing less than extraordinary. I began to expect it as well, and my extraordinary moment came in 2014 when I created a Kickstater project for a game I created called “[Translation!](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thebetabox/translation-the-60-second-language-game)”. The purpose of the game was to teach foreign language through vocabulary associations in social environments, and although my campaign was not financially successful, I learned more than I ever expected about what it takes to develop, and push an idea into market. Ultimately, the cost to produce my game as I had envisioned it was too high, and I made the decision to attempt to create an app for my game so that it would still be available to all the backers that supported my campaign. But that cost proved to be even more expensive than my original cost! That’s when I decided, that I would never let someone else’s prices dictate my ability to produce again, and I started learning how to build my game on my own.
  
  I’ve been at it now for about a year and a half, and I’m still very optimistic! Everyday has been a learning experience, and new technologies pop up everyday, giving me more options, and exciting problems to figure out. The only downside is that when you are completely new to programming like I was, it can be really difficult to navigate your way through all the information available. Luckily, for me and many other diligent learners the Flatiron school has created a wonderful program that makes the process easier than it’s ever been. Yaaay!!
